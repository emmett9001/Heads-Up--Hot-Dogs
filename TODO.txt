// TODO - implement new pause screen layout from mockup
        //TODO - preload as many assets as possible
                        // TODO - it's possible to throw dogs offscreen of they pass by a head first. stop that. 
    // TODO - importing all of these defeats part of the purpose of using different sprite sheets
    // TODO - people per level
    // TODO - store high score per level
    // TODO - separate bodyuserdata into two structs, one for dogs and one for people - will probably reduce memory use slightly?
