// TODO - implement new pause screen layout from mockup
            // TODO - move attributes of special dog to level structure
        //TODO - preload as many assets as possible
                        // TODO - it's possible to throw dogs offscreen of they pass by a head first. stop that. 
                                        // TODO - this only works for forward-facing cops, do the math and make it work for both
                    //TODO - make all global components of cop raycasting into instance variables to allow maybe multiple cops onscreen
    // TODO - spritesheet per level, divide into "common" and "per level" sheets
    // TODO - audio per level
    // TODO - collection audio from emails
    // TODO - separate bodyuserdata into two structs, one for dogs and one for people - will probably reduce memory use slightly?
