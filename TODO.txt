// TODO - evaluate the possibility of putting as many of these utility functions as possible into an importable file
    //TODO - possibly use setActive() here instead of the kinda-hacky friction manipulation
    //TODO - remove the overlay sprite here since it's now the cop's deal
        //TODO - uncomment the conditional, it's commented out for testing only
        // TODO - widen both these and the floors so we can't see people dropping in from the sides
                // TODO - use ud->dogsOnHead to keep angry faces on when walks start
                                        // TODO - this only works for forward-facing cops, do the math and make it work for both
                                        // TODO - have target follow dog if dog is in range
                    //TODO - make all global components of cop raycasting into instance variables to allow maybe multiple cops onscreen
