// TODO - evaluate the possibility of putting as many of these utility functions as possible into an importable file
        //TODO - put these color defs all in one place for easy editing
    //TODO - possibly use setActive() here instead of the kinda-hacky friction manipulation
        // TODO - zero these out on first init
                // TODO - use ud->dogsOnHead to keep angry faces on when walks start
                                        // TODO - this only works for forward-facing cops, do the math and make it work for both
                    //TODO - make all global components of cop raycasting into instance variables to allow maybe multiple cops onscreen
                        // TODO - add a bonus animation here
